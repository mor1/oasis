* Finish guess-cmx to install all files for libraries, integrate it in buildsys
* Use "# line_num file" in OCaml generated file to locate real source (in
  particular in myocamlbuild.ml.in)
* Find why sometimes file get erased when updated
* Stop using buildsys.ml as central point, split it to provide configure and
  install, build is handled by ocamlbuild. Still provide Makefile, setup.sh and
  setup.bat (+autobuild.ml for internal system)
