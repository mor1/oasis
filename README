OCaml-autobuild is designed to provide a standard way to setup configure, build
and install system for OCaml project. It can be compared to automake but
targeted to OCaml application (automake is targeted to C/C++ application). 

OCaml-autobuild provide:
- reasonable setup for sub-system (configure, build and install)
- standard call to configure, build and install
- description of the project and subsystem through OASIS

OCaml-autobuild handle the following sub-system:
- configure: 
  - autoconf (TODO)
  - default (system provided by OCaml-autobuild)
- build:
  - ocamlbuid
  - OCamlMakefile (TODO)
  - OMake (TODO)
- install:
  - findlib (libraries)
  - internal (executable and data)

The whole system depends on findlib.
